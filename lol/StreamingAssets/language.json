    "opening-cinematic-3": "Animals need energy to perform their life processes.",
    "opening-cinematic-4": "The energy in an animal’s food was once energy from the Sun that was captured by plants.",
    "hunt-1-opening-1": "This is Mr. Fox, and he needs food for energy.",
    "hunt-1-opening-2": "Mr. Fox is a carnivore so he only eats meat.",

    "energy-1-opening-2": "The chemical energy in food can be transformed into motion energy that allows an animal to move its body.",
    "energy-1-opening-3": "Let's distribute the energy to Mr.Fox's body! And let's see what happens next.",
    "energy-1-opening-4": "Let's connect the energy in order!",
    "energy-1-success-1": "Keep going!",
    "energy-1-complete-1": "In the process of metabolism, food is broken down into forms of energy that can be used for an animal’s growth.",

    "eat-3-complete-1": "Great now let's distribute the energy once more!",
    "energy-3-opening-1": "Let's distribute the energy so Mr.Fox can warm up.",
    "energy-3-complete-1": "Well done! Mr.Fox is feeling comfy right now!",
